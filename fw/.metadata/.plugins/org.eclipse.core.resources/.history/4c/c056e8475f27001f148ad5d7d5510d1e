 *
 * The sensor will register any hit on the front row (scoring) and back row(side indication) and measure the time between the two if the pellet
 * triggers both.
 *
 * It uses one timer to both time the pellet between the rows and to use as a 1 ms timeout to allow for registration from multiple channels
 * triggered by the same pellet.
 *
 * The sensor will average the result between the adjacent triggered diodes. It doubles the resolution of the system by using this method.
 *
 * Output is in scale [-16, 16] with all even numbers representing a single photodiode, and every odd number representing two photodiodes triggered
 * at the same time.
