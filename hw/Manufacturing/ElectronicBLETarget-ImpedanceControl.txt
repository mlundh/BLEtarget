Impedance control required

1) 50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-ended Microstrip
L1 (ref L2)
Trace width = 0.19mm

2) 90 Ohms (+-10%) Differential Microstrip (50 Ohms +-10% Single-Ended))
L1 (ref L2)
Trace width = 0.22mm
Trace spacing = 0.15mm

Confirm trace widths and spacing. Adjust stack-up as necessary.
